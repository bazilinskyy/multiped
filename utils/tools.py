class Tools():
    """
    A utility class providing helper functions for data processing in time-series and participant tracking experiments.

    This class offers methods to:
        - Parse and process DataFrame columns containing string-encoded lists or quaternions.
        - Flatten nested data structures for analysis.
        - Extract and compute statistical features (such as means or yaws)
        from experimental data stored in CSV or DataFrame formats.

    Methods in this class expect data with a specific structure, such as DataFrames with a 'Timestamp'
    column and participant columns containing lists encoded as strings, and may utilise external
    tools for quaternion-to-euler conversions.

    Usage example:
        tools = Tools()
        avg_df = tools.average_dataframe_vectors_with_timestamp(df, "average")
        yaws = tools.all_yaws_per_bin("data.csv")
        flat = tools.flatten_trial_matrix(nested_list)

        Calculates the mean of all vector-type columns for each row in a DataFrame, excluding the 'Timestamp' column.
        The function assumes that each non-'Timestamp' column contains either a list of numbers or a string
        representation of such a list. It computes the mean of each vector per row, then averages these means
        for each row, associating the result with its timestamp.

                                vectors (as lists or string representations of lists).

            pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with columns 'Timestamp' and the specified column_name, where each row
